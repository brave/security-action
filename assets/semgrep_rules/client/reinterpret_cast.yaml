    message: "Using `reinterpret_cast` against some data types may lead to undefined bheaviour. In general, when needing to do these conversions, check how Chromium upstream does them. Most of the times a reinterpret_cast is wrong and there's no guarantee the compiler will generate the code that you thought it would."
