    message: >-
      Use --index-url instead of --extra-index-url to avoid dependency confusion.
      When using --extra-index-url, pip looks on pypi.org as well as the private index.
      It may install a malicious package from pypi.org with the same name as your private package instead of the package in your private index.
    severity: INFO

      - generic
