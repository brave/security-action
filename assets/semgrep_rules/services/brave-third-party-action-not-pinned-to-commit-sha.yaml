    severity: ERROR
    message: An action sourced from a third-party repository on GitHub is not pinned
      to a full length commit SHA. Pinning an action to a full length commit SHA
      is currently the only way to use an action as an immutable release.
      Pinning to a particular SHA helps mitigate the risk of a bad actor adding
      a backdoor to the action's repository, as they would need to generate a
      SHA-1 collision for a valid Git object payload.
