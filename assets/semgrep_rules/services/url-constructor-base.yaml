    message: Are you using the `URL(url, base)` constructor as a security control to limit the origin with base `$BASE`? The base is ignored whenever url looks like an absolute URL, e.g. when it begins `protocol://`. `\\\\` or `//x.y`. Verify that the URL's origin is as expected rather than relying on the URL constructor.
