  message: |
    base::Unretained is most of the time unrequited, and a weak reference is better suited for secure coding.
    Consider swapping Unretained for a weak reference.
    base::Unretained usage may be acceptable when a callback owner is guaranteed
    to be destroyed with the object base::Unretained is pointing to, for example:
    
    - PrefChangeRegistrar
    - base::*Timer
    - mojo::Receiver
    - any other class member destroyed when the class is deallocated
