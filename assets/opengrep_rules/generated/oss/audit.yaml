  message: |
    The application may be vulnerable to a path traversal if it extracts untrusted archive files.
    This vulnerability is colloquially known as 'Zip Slip'. Archive files may contain folders
    which,
    when extracted, may write outside of the intended directory. This is exploited by including
    path traversal characters such as `../../other/directory` to overwrite or place files in system
    or application directories.

    Extra care must be taken when extracting archive files as there are numerous concerns:

    - If possible, generate unique filenames instead of using the archives file names, as it may be
    possible for users to overwrite files if the filenames are the same.
    - Validate file paths are written with a prefixed, known trusted directory.
    - Only process regular files and not symbolic links, as some applications may attempt to
    read/follow
    the symbolic link, leading to arbitrary file read / write vulnerabilities.

    Example of securely processing an archive file:
    ```
    import tarfile
    import uuid
    # import os

    tar = tarfile.open('some.tar')

    # Max number of allowed files in our archive
    max_files = 10
    # Max size for all files in archive
    max_size = 1024 * 1024 * 10 # 10MB
    # Max size per file in archive
    max_file_size = 1024 * 1024 # 1MB

    # Validate number of files in archive
    if len(tar.getmembers()) > max_files:
        raise Exception("Too many files in archive")

    total_size = 0
    # Loop over all files to see if we exceed max size
    # if so, do not process any of them.
    for f in tar.getmembers():
        total_size += f.size
        if total_size >= max_size:
            raise Exception("Archive files exceeded max file size")

    # Iterate over files now that we know the total size is within limits
    for f in tar.getmembers():
        # Internally this calls TarInfo.isreg() which ensures
        # the file is a regular file and not a sym link or directory
        if not f.isfile():
            continue

        # Optional, set a limit on each file size
        if f.size > max_file_size:
            raise Exception(f"File {f.name} too large: {f.size}")

        # If original names are required, ensure that only the
        # filename is used:
        # filename = os.path.basename(f.name)

        # More secure, generate a UUID4 value instead
        filename = uuid.uuid4().hex

        # Reset the archive filename to the basename
        # Newer versions of python (3.11.4+) should use:
        # new_tar = old_tar.replace(name=...new name...)
        f.name = filename

        # Extract the file into a restricted directory, with our
        # own user's attributes, not the file from the archive
        tar.extract(f, '/opt/app/restricted/', set_attrs=False)

    The application was found using `pickle` which is vulnerable to deserialization attacks.
    Deserialization attacks exploit the process of reading serialized data and turning it back
    into an object. By constructing malicious objects and serializing them, an adversary may
    attempt to:

    - Inject code that is executed upon object construction, which occurs during the
    deserialization process.
    - Exploit mass assignment by including fields that are not normally a part of the serialized
    data but are read in during deserialization.

    Consider safer alternatives such as serializing data in the JSON format. Ensure any format
    chosen allows the application to specify exactly which object types are allowed to be deserialized.

    To protect against mass assignment, only allow deserialization of the specific fields that are
    required. If this is not easily done, consider creating an intermediary type that
    can be serialized with only the necessary fields exposed.

    Example JSON deserializer using an intermediary type that is validated against a schema to ensure
    it is safe from mass assignment:
    ```
    import jsonschema

    # Create a schema to validate our user-supplied input against
    # an intermediary object
    intermediary_schema = {
        "type" : "object",
        "properties" :  {
            "name": {"type" : "string"}
        },
        "required": ["name"],
        # Protect against random properties being added to the object
        "additionalProperties": False,
    }
    # If a user attempted to add "'is_admin': True" it would cause a validation error
    intermediary_object = {'name': 'test user'}

    try:
        # Validate the user supplied intermediary object against our schema
        jsonschema.validate(instance=intermediary_object, schema=intermediary_schema)
        user_object = {'user':
            {
                # Assign the deserialized data from intermediary object
                'name': intermediary_object['name'],
                # Add in protected data in object definition (or set it from a class constructor)
                'is_admin': False,
            }
        }
        # Work with the user_object
    except jsonschema.exceptions.ValidationError as ex:
        # Gracefully handle validation errors
        # ...

    Deserialization attacks exploit the process of reading serialized data and turning it back
    into an object. By constructing malicious objects and serializing them, an adversary may
    attempt to:

    - Inject code that is executed upon object construction, which occurs during the
    deserialization process.
    - Exploit mass assignment by including fields that are not normally a part of the serialized
    data but are read in during deserialization.

    Consider safer alternatives such as serializing data in the JSON format. Ensure any format
    chosen allows
    the application to specify exactly which object types are allowed to be deserialized.

    To protect against mass assignment, only allow deserialization of the specific fields that are
    required. If this is not easily done, consider creating an intermediary type that
    can be serialized with only the necessary fields exposed.

    Example JSON deserializer using an intermediary type that is validated against a schema to
    ensure
    it is safe from mass assignment:
    ```
    import jsonschema

    # Create a schema to validate our user-supplied input against
    # an intermediary object
    intermediary_schema = {
        "type" : "object",
        "properties" :  {
            "name": {"type" : "string"}
        },
        "required": ["name"],
        # Protect against random properties being added to the object
        "additionalProperties": False,
    }
    # If a user attempted to add "'is_admin': True" it would cause a validation error
    intermediary_object = {'name': 'test user'}

    try:
        # Validate the user supplied intermediary object against our schema
        jsonschema.validate(instance=intermediary_object, schema=intermediary_schema)
        user_object = {'user':
            {
                # Assign the deserialized data from intermediary object
                'name': intermediary_object['name'],
                # Add in protected data in object definition (or set it from a class constructor)
                'is_admin': False,
            }
        }
        # Work with the user_object

    DES, TripleDES, RC2 and RC4 are all considered broken or insecure cryptographic algorithms.
    Newer algorithms apply message integrity to validate ciphertext has not been tampered
    with. Consider using `ChaCha20Poly1305` instead as it is easier and faster than the
    alternatives such as `AES-256-GCM`.

    For older applications that don't have support for `ChaCha20Poly1305`,
    `AES-256-GCM` is recommended, however it has many drawbacks:
    - Slower than `ChaCha20Poly1305`.
    - Catastrophic failure if nonce values are reused.

    Example using `ChaCha20Poly1305`:
    ```
    import os
    # Import ChaCha20Poly1305 from cryptography
    from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import ChaCha20Poly1305
    # Our plaintext to encrypt
    plain_text = b"Secret text to encrypt"
    # We do not require authenticated but unencrypted data, so set to None
    aad = None
    # Generate a secure key
    key = ChaCha20Poly1305.generate_key()
    # Create a new ChaCha20Poly1305 instance with our secure key
    chacha = ChaCha20Poly1305(key)
    # Note: nonce values _must_ be regenerated every time they are used.
    nonce = os.urandom(12)
    # Encrypt our plaintext
    cipher_text = chacha.encrypt(nonce, plain_text, aad)
    # Decrypt the plain text using the nonce and cipher_text
    chacha.decrypt(nonce, cipher_text, aad)
    ```

    Example using `AESGCM`:
    ```
    import os
    # Import AESGCM from cryptography
    from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM
    # Our plaintext to encrypt
    plain_text = b"Secret text to encrypt"
    # We do not require authenticated but unencrypted data, so set to None
    aad = None
    # Generate a secure key
    key = AESGCM.generate_key(bit_length=128)
    # Create a new AESGCM instance with our secure key
    aesgcm = AESGCM(key)
    # Note: nonce values _must_ be regenerated every time they are used.
    nonce = os.urandom(12)

  message: |
    The application was found using an insecure or risky digest or signature algorithm. MD5
    and SHA1 hash algorithms have been found to be vulnerable to producing collisions.

    This means
    that two different values, when hashed, can lead to the same hash value. If the application is
    trying
    to use these hash methods for storing passwords, then it is recommended to switch to a
    password hashing
    algorithm such as Argon2id or PBKDF2.
    It is strongly recommended that a standard digest algorithm be chosen instead as implementing
    a custom algorithm is prone to errors.

    Note that the `Crypto` and `Cryptodome` Python packages are no longer recommended for
    new applications, instead consider using the [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/) package.

    Example of creating a SHA-384 hash using the `cryptography` package:
    ```
    from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
    # Create a SHA384 digest
    digest = hashes.Hash(hashes.SHA384())
    # Update the digest with some initial data
    digest.update(b"some data to hash")
    # Add more data to the digest
    digest.update(b"some more data")
    # Finalize the digest as bytes
    result = digest.finalize()
    ```

    The Blowfish encryption algorithm was meant as a drop-in replacement for DES and was created in

    exist, it should never be used to encrypt files over 4GB in size. If possible consider

    Instead of using an algorithm that requires configuring a cipher mode, an algorithm
    that has built-in message integrity should be used. Consider using `ChaCha20Poly1305` or
    `AES-256-GCM` instead.

    For older applications that don't have support for `ChaCha20Poly1305`, `AES-256-GCM` is
    recommended, however it has many drawbacks:
      - Slower than `ChaCha20Poly1305`.
      - Catastrophic failure if nonce values are reused.

    Example using `ChaCha20Poly1305`:
    ```
    import os
    # Import ChaCha20Poly1305 from cryptography
    from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import ChaCha20Poly1305
    # Our plaintext to encrypt
    plain_text = b"Secret text to encrypt"
    # We do not require authenticated but unencrypted data, so set to None
    aad = None
    # Generate a secure key
    key = ChaCha20Poly1305.generate_key()
    # Create a new ChaCha20Poly1305 instance with our secure key
    chacha = ChaCha20Poly1305(key)
    # Note: nonce values _must_ be regenerated every time they are used.
    nonce = os.urandom(12)
    # Encrypt our plaintext
    cipher_text = chacha.encrypt(nonce, plain_text, aad)
    # Decrypt the plain text using the nonce and cipher_text
    chacha.decrypt(nonce, cipher_text, aad)
    ```

    Example using `AESGCM`:
    ```
    import os
    # Import AESGCM from cryptography
    from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM
    # Our plaintext to encrypt
    plain_text = b"Secret text to encrypt"
    # We do not require authenticated but unencrypted data, so set to None
    aad = None
    # Generate a secure key
    key = AESGCM.generate_key(bit_length=128)
    # Create a new AESGCM instance with our secure key
    aesgcm = AESGCM(key)
    # Note: nonce values _must_ be regenerated every time they are used.
    nonce = os.urandom(12)
    # Encrypt our plaintext
    cipher_text = aesgcm.encrypt(nonce, plain_text, aad)
    # Decrypt the plain text using the nonce and cipher_text
    aesgcm.decrypt(nonce, cipher_text, aad)
    ```

    The application was found creating temporary files with the insecure `mktemp` method.
    Depending on how the application uses this temporary file, an attacker may be able to create
    symlinks that point to other files prior to the application creating or writing
    to the target file, leading to unintended files being created or overwritten.

    To remediate this issue consider using `tempfile.TemporaryFile` instead.

    Example using `tempfile.TemporaryFile` to write a file:
    ```
    import tempfile

        # Write some data to the temporary file

    The application was found creating a SSL context using the `_create_unverified_context`.
    This effectively disables the validation of server certificates.

    This allows for an adversary who is in between the application and the target host to intercept
    potentially sensitive information or transmit malicious data.

    To remediate this issue remove the call to `_create_unverified_context` and either create a
    default
    context using `ssl.create_default_context` or create a context with TLS 1.3.

    Example creating a TLS 1.3 client socket connection by using a newer version of Python
    (3.11.4) and
    the SSL module:
    ```
    import ssl
    import socket

    # Create our initial socket
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as sock:
        # Connect the socket
        sock.connect(('www.example.org', 443))

        # Create a new SSLContext with protocol set to ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT
        # This will auto-select the highest grade TLS protocol version (1.3)
        context = ssl.SSLContext(protocol=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT)
        # Load our a certificates for server certificate authentication
        context.load_verify_locations('cert.pem')
        # Create our TLS socket, and validate the server hostname matches
        with context.wrap_socket(sock, server_hostname="www.example.org") as tls_sock:
            # Send some bytes over the socket (HTTP request in this case)\
            data = bytes('GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.org\r\n\r\n', 'utf-8')
            sent_bytes = tls_sock.send(data)
            # Validate number of sent bytes
            # ...
            # Read the response
            resp = tls_sock.recv()
            # Work with the response
            # ...
    ```

    Unverified SSL context detected. This will permit insecure connections without `verifyingSSL`
    certificates. Use `ssl.create_default_context()` instead.

    The application was found using an insecure or risky digest or signature algorithm. MD2, MD4,
    MD5  and SHA1 hash algorithms have been found to be vulnerable to producing collisions.

    This means
    that two different values, when hashed, can lead to the same hash value. If the application is
    trying
    to use these hash methods for storing passwords, then it is recommended to switch to a
    password hashing
    algorithm such as Argon2id or PBKDF2.
    It is strongly recommended that a standard digest algorithm be chosen instead as implementing
    a custom algorithm is prone to errors.

    Example using `hashlib.sha384()` to create a SHA384 hash:
    ```
    import hashlib
    # Create a SHA384 digest
    digest = hashlib.sha384()
    # Update the digest with some initial data
    digest.update(b"some data to hash")
    # Add more data to the digest
    digest.update(b"some more data")
    # Finalize the digest as bytes

    The application was found using the `requests` module without configuring a timeout value for

    This allows for an adversary who is in between the application and the target host to intercept
    potentially sensitive information or transmit malicious data.

    To remediate this issue either remove the `verify=False` argument, or set `verify=True`to each

    The application was found calling an SSL module with SSL or TLS protocols that have known
    deficiencies.
    It is strongly recommended that newer applications use TLS 1.2 or 1.3 and
    `SSLContext.wrap_socket`.

    If using the `pyOpenSSL` module, please note that it has been deprecated and the Python
    Cryptographic Authority
    strongly suggests moving to use the [pyca/cryptography](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography)
    module instead.

    To remediate this issue for the `ssl` module, create a new TLS context and pass in
    `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT` for clients or `ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_SERVER` for servers to the
    `ssl.SSLContext(...)` `protocol=`
    argument. When converting the socket to a TLS socket, use the new `SSLContext.wrap_socket`
    method instead.

    Example creating a TLS 1.3 client socket connection by using a newer version of Python
    (3.11.4) and
    the SSL module:
    ```
    import ssl
    import socket

    # Create our initial socket
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as sock:
        # Connect the socket
        sock.connect(('www.example.org', 443))

        # Create a new SSLContext with protocol set to ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT
        # This will auto-select the highest grade TLS protocol version (1.3)
        context = ssl.SSLContext(protocol=ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT)
        # Load our a certificates for server certificate authentication
        context.load_verify_locations('cert.pem')
        # Create our TLS socket, and validate the server hostname matches
        with context.wrap_socket(sock, server_hostname="www.example.org") as tls_sock:
            # Send some bytes over the socket (HTTP request in this case)\
            data = bytes('GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.org\r\n\r\n', 'utf-8')
            sent_bytes = tls_sock.send(data)
            # Validate number of sent bytes
            # ...
            # Read the response
            resp = tls_sock.recv()

    The application is generating an RSA key that is less than the recommended 2048 bits.
    The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) deprecated signing Digital
    Certificates that contained RSA Public Keys of 1024 bits in December 2010. While
    1024-bit RSA keys have not been factored yet, advances in compute may make it possible
    in the near future.

    Consider upgrading to the newer asymmetric algorithm such as `X25519` which handles
    the complexities of generating key pairs and choosing correct key sizes for you:
    ```
    from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.x25519 import X25519PrivateKey

    # Generate a private key for use in the exchange.
    private_key = X25519PrivateKey.generate()
    # Work with private key/exchange with a peer's
    # public key to created a shared and derived key
    # ...
    ```

    Otherwise use a key size greater than 2048 when generating RSA keys:
    ```
    from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import rsa
    # Generate a private key of 4096 bits
    private_key = rsa.generate_private_key(
        # do not change the exponent value from 65537
        public_exponent=65537,
        key_size=4096,
    )
    # Work with the private key to sign/encrypt data

    The application was found using an unsafe version of `yaml` load which is vulnerable to
    deserialization attacks. Deserialization attacks exploit the process of reading serialized
    data and turning it back
    into an object. By constructing malicious objects and serializing them, an adversary may
    attempt to:

    - Inject code that is executed upon object construction, which occurs during the
    deserialization process.
    - Exploit mass assignment by including fields that are not normally a part of the serialized
    data but are read in during deserialization.

    To remediate this issue, use `safe_load()` or call `yaml.load()` with the `Loader` argument
    set to
    `yaml.SafeLoader`.

    Example loading YAML using `safe_load`:
    ```
    import yaml

    # Use safe_load to load data into an intermediary object
    intermediary_object = yaml.safe_load("""user:
        name: 'test user'"""
    )
    # Create our real object, copying over only the necessary fields
    user_object = {'user': {
            # Assign the deserialized data from intermediary object
            'name': intermediary_object['user']['name'],

            'is_admin': False,

  message: |
    The application was found to ignore host keys. Host keys are important as
    they provide assurance that the client can prove that the host is trusted.
    By ignoring these host keys, it is impossible for the client to validate the
    connection is to a trusted host.

    To remediate this issue, remove the call to `set_missing_host_key_policy(...)` which
    sets the host key policy. Instead, load key files using either `load_system_host_keys`
    or `load_host_keys` to only allow known good hosts. By not setting a host key policy
    for unknown hosts, `paramiko`'s default policy is to use `RejectPolicy`.

    Example configuration connecting to a known, trusted host, and not allowing connections
    to unknown hosts:
    ```
    import paramiko

    # Create an SSH client
    with paramiko.SSHClient() as ssh:
        # Load the system host keys so we can confirm the
        # host we are connecting to is legitimate
        ssh.load_system_host_keys('/home/appuser/.ssh/known_hosts')

        # Connect to the remote host using our SSH private key
        ssh.connect(hostname='example.org',
                    port=22,
                    username='appuser',
                    key_filename='/home/appuser/.ssh/private_key')
    ```

    Pysnmp was detected using versions SNMPv1 or SNMPv2. SNPMv1 and SNMPv2 are insecure
    and should no longer be used as they do not offer encryption.

    If possible, query SNMP devices using SNMPv3 instead.

    Example querying a device using SNMPv3 with SHA-AES:
    ```
    from pysnmp.hlapi import *
    # Create the snpm iterator
    iterator = getCmd(
        SnmpEngine(),
        # Configure using SHA AES
        UsmUserData('usr-sha-aes', 'authkey1', 'privkey1',
                    authProtocol=USM_AUTH_HMAC96_SHA,
                    privProtocol=USM_PRIV_CFB128_AES),

        ContextData(),

  message: |
    SQL Injection is a critical vulnerability that can lead to data or system compromise. By
    dynamically generating SQL query strings, user input may be able to influence the logic of
    the SQL statement. This could lead to an adversary accessing information they should
    not have access to, or in some circumstances, being able to execute OS functionality or code.

    Replace all dynamically generated SQL queries with parameterized queries. In situations where
    dynamic queries must be created, never use direct user input, but instead use a map or
    dictionary of valid values and resolve them using a user supplied key.

    For example, some database drivers do not allow parameterized queries for `>` or `<` comparison
    operators. In these cases, do not use a user supplied `>` or `<` value, but rather have the
    user
    supply a `gt` or `lt` value. The alphabetical values are then used to look up the `>` and `<`
    values to be used in the construction of the dynamic query. The same goes for other queries
    where
    column or table names are required but cannot be parameterized.

    Example using `PreparedStatement` queries:
    ```
    import sqlite3

    # Create a new database (in memory)
    con = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
    # Get a cursor from the connection
    cur = con.cursor()
    # Create a tuple of the value to be used in the parameterized query
    params = ('user-input',)
    # execute the statement, passing in the params for the value
    cur.execute("select name from sqlite_master where name = ?", params)
    # work with the result
    result = cur.fetchall()
    ```

    The `QuerySet.extra` API method will be deprecated as it a source of SQL Injection
    vulnerabilities and other problems. This method is especially risky as callers
    will need to do their own escaping of any parameters that come from user-supplied
    information.

    To remediate this issue, do not use `extra` but use other `QuerySet` methods to achieve
    the same goals. If for some reason this is not feasible, consider using the `RawSQL` method
    and making sure that all arguments, including user-supplied ones, are only used in
    `params`


    While not recommended due to [potential SQL
    Injection](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/models/expressions/#raw-sql-expressions),
    below is an example using `RawSQL`,
    passing in user-supplied data as a `param` which will escape the input:
    ```

    # path configuration: path('<int:user_supplied_id>/someview/', views.some_view,
    name='someview'),

    # views.py
    def some_view(request, user_supplied_id):
      # Never use string interpolation in the `sql` parameter.
      # Never quote the `%s` string format such as `... where id='%s'` as this could lead to SQL
    Injection.
      # Pass the user supplied data only in the `params` parameter.
      for obj in DBObject.objects.all().annotate(

    The application was found using Jinja2 `Environment` without autoescaping enabled. If using in
    the context of HTML this could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks when rendering with
    user-supplied input.

    Unfortunately, Jinja2 does not support context-aware escaping, meaning it is insufficient to
    protect against
    XSS for the various web contexts. It is important to encode the data depending on the specific
    context
    it
    is used in. There are at least six context types:

    - Inside HTML tags `<div>context 1</div>`
    - Inside attributes: `<div class="context 2"></div>`
    - Inside event attributes `<button onclick="context 3">button</button>`
    - Inside script blocks: `<script>var x = "context 4"</script>`
    - Unsafe element HTML assignment: `element.innerHTML = "context 5"`
    - Inside URLs: `<iframe src="context 6"></iframe><a href="context 6">link</a>`

    Script blocks alone have multiple ways they need to be encoded. Extra care must be taken if
    user input
    is ever output inside of script tags.

    User input that is displayed within the application must be encoded, sanitized or validated
    to ensure it cannot be treated as HTML or executed as Javascript code. Care must also be
    taken
    to not mix server-side templating with client-side templating, as the server-side templating
    will
    not encode things like {{ 7*7 }} which may execute client-side templating features.

    It is _NOT_ advised to encode user input prior to inserting into a data store. The data will
    need to be
    encoded depending on context of where it is output. It is much safer to force the displaying
    system to
    handle the encoding and not attempt to guess how it should be encoded.

    To handle different contexts, one approach would be to write custom Jinja2 filters. Below is
    an example
    that escapes or encodes links and potentially malicious script, note this does not include
    other contexts
    such as CSS or attributes:
    ```
    from jinja2 import Environment, select_autoescape, FileSystemLoader
    from jinja2 import pass_eval_context
    from markupsafe import Markup, escape

    @pass_eval_context
    def escape_link(eval_ctx, value):
        bad_link = "#JinjatmplZ"
        # Block any values that start with // as that could be used to inject
        # links to third party pages see:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Protocol-relative_URL
        if value.startswith('//'):
            return bad_link

        # Only allow relative links
        # if you want to allow links that start with http or ws replace with below:
        # if not value.startswith('/'): and not value.startswith('http') and not
    value.startswith('ws')
        if not value.startswith('/'):
            return bad_link

        # Alternatively, you could only call escape if autoescape is true
        # if eval_ctx.autoescape:
        #    return escape(value)
        # else
        #    return value

        return escape(value)

    # Create a replacement table

  message: |
    The Blowfish encryption algorithm was meant as a drop-in replacement for DES and was created in
    1993. Smaller key sizes may make the ciphertext vulnerable to [birthday
    attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack). While no known attacks against
    Blowfish
    exist, it should never be used to encrypt files over 4GB in size. If possible consider
    using AES as the instance of `KeyGenerator` instead of Blowfish.

    To remediate the small key size, pass a value such as 256 to the `KeyGenerator.init(keySize)`
    method.

    Example setting a larger key size and changing to `KeyGenerator` to AES:
    ```
    public static void aesKeyGenerator() throws java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        // Use the AES algorithm for key generation
        KeyGenerator keyGenerator = KeyGenerator.getInstance("AES");

        // Set the key size here
        keyGenerator.init(256);

        // get the raw bytes of the key
        byte[] key = keyGenerator.generateKey().getEncoded();

        // pass the key bytes to create a SecretKeySpec
        SecretKeySpec secretKeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(key, "AES");
    }
    ```

    Example setting a larger key size for Blowfish:
    ```
    public static void blowFishKeyGenerator() throws java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        // Use the Blowfish algorithm for key generation
        KeyGenerator keyGenerator = KeyGenerator.getInstance("Blowfish");

        // Set the key size here

    Cryptographic algorithms provide many different modes of operation, only some of which provide
    message integrity. Without message integrity it could be possible for an adversary to attempt
    to tamper with the ciphertext which could lead to compromising the encryption key. Newer
    algorithms
    apply message integrity to validate ciphertext has not been tampered with.

    Instead of using an algorithm that requires configuring a cipher mode, an algorithm
    that has built-in message integrity should be used. Consider using `ChaCha20Poly1305` or
    `AES-256-GCM` instead.

    For older applications that don't have support for `ChaCha20Poly1305`, `AES-256-GCM` is
    recommended, however it has many drawbacks:
      - Slower than `ChaCha20Poly1305`.
      - Catastrophic failure if nonce values are reused.

    Example using `ChaCha20Poly1305`:
    ```
    public encrypt() throws Exception {

  message: |
    OS command injection is a critical vulnerability that can lead to a full system
    compromise as it may allow an adversary to pass in arbitrary commands or arguments
    to be executed.

    User input should never be used in constructing commands or command arguments
    to functions which execute OS commands. This includes filenames supplied by
    user uploads or downloads.

    Ensure your application does not:

    - Use user-supplied information in the process name to execute.
    - Use user-supplied information in an OS command execution function which does
    not escape shell meta-characters.
    - Use user-supplied information in arguments to OS commands.

    The application should have a hardcoded set of arguments that are to be passed
    to OS commands. If filenames are being passed to these functions, it is
    recommended that a hash of the filename be used instead, or some other unique
    identifier. It is strongly recommended that a native library that implements
    the same functionality be used instead of using OS system commands, due to the
    risk of unknown attacks against third party commands.

    When specifying the OS command, ensure the application uses the full path
    information, otherwise the OS may attempt to look up which process to execute
    and could be vulnerable to untrusted search path vulnerabilities (CWE-426).

    Example of safely executing an OS command:
    ```
    public static void executeCommand(String userFileData) throws java.io.IOException {
        // Generate a random filename, do not use user input
        String fileName = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
        // Create a Buffered/FileWriter
        BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(fileName));
        // Write the user content to our random file
        writer.write(userFileData);
        // Close the file to flush contents
        writer.close();
        // Create the process builder with a hardcoded path to the binary, and our randomly
    generated filename
        ProcessBuilder processBuilder = new ProcessBuilder("/opt/app/path", fileName);
        // Start the process
        Process process = processBuilder.start();
        // Handle/redirect output of process here
        // ...
    }
    ```

    The application was found to take data from user input and output it into a logger method.
    When data from
    an untrusted source is sent to a logger without validation, an attacker could forge log
    entries
    or include malicious content. If the log file is processed automatically, the attacker can
    render the file unusable by corrupting the format of the file or injecting unexpected
    characters. An attacker may also inject code or other commands into the log file and take
    advantage of a vulnerability in the log processing utility (e.g. command injection or XSS).

    To mitigate this issue, encode values that come from user input with a package such as
    [Apache Commons Text](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/) to escape the input:
    ```
    public String escapeValue(String value) {
      return StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava(value);
    }

  message: |
    SQL Injection is a critical vulnerability that can lead to data or system compromise. By
    dynamically generating SQL query strings, user input may be able to influence the logic of
    the SQL statement. This could lead to an adversary accessing information they should
    not have access to, or in some circumstances, being able to execute OS functionality or code.

    Replace all dynamically generated SQL queries with parameterized queries. In situations where
    dynamic queries must be created, never use direct user input, but instead use a map or
    dictionary of valid values and resolve them using a user-supplied key.

    For example, some database drivers do not allow parameterized queries for `>` or `<` comparison
    operators. In these cases, do not use a user supplied `>` or `<` value, but rather have the
    user
    supply a `gt` or `lt` value. The alphabetical values are then used to look up the `>` and `<`
    values to be used in the construction of the dynamic query. The same goes for other queries
    where
    column or table names are required but cannot be parameterized.

    Example using `PreparedStatement` queries:
    ```
    // Some userInput
    String userInput = "someUserInput";
    // Your connection string
    String url = "...";
    // Get a connection from the DB via the DriverManager
    Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url);
    // Create a prepared statement
    PreparedStatement st = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT name FROM table where name=?");
    // Set each parameters value by the index (starting from 1)
    st.setString(1, userInput);
    // Execute query and get the result set
    ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery();
    // Iterate over results
    while (rs.next()) {
        // Get result for this row at the provided column number (starting from 1)
        String result = rs.getString(1);
        // ...
    }
    // Close the ResultSet
    rs.close();
    // Close the PreparedStatement
    st.close();
    ```

    Cryptographic algorithms provide many different modes of operation, only some of which provide
    message integrity. Without message integrity it could be possible for an adversary to attempt
    to tamper with the ciphertext which could lead to compromising the encryption key. Newer
    algorithms
    apply message integrity to validate ciphertext has not been tampered with.

    Instead of using an algorithm that requires configuring a cipher mode, an algorithm
    that has built-in message integrity should be used. Consider using `ChaCha20Poly1305` or
    `AES-256-GCM` instead.

    For older applications that don't have support for `ChaCha20Poly1305`, `AES-256-GCM` is
    recommended, however it has many drawbacks:
      - Slower than `ChaCha20Poly1305`.
      - Catastrophic failure if nonce values are reused.

    Example using `ChaCha20Poly1305`:
    ```

  languages:

  message: |
    The filename provided by the FileUpload API can be tampered with
    which could lead to unauthorized access or file inclusion vulnerabilities.
    To mitigate this risk, it is essential to conduct rigorous validation of the
    filenames provided by clients. This validation should ensure that the filename
    adheres to a predefined structure, is devoid of potentially dangerous characters
    (such as forward slashes / and backslashes \), and corresponds to an authorized
    file only.

    For example, as a remediation strategy, the application could:
    1. Sanitize Filenames: Create a function to sanitize filenames by removing
       or replacing unauthorized characters, including path traversal sequences (../ or ..\).
    2. Allowlist Validation: Implement a allowlist approach, allowing only filenames
       that match a specific pattern or are part of a predefined list.
    3. Use Server-Generated Filenames: Rather than relying on client-provided filenames,
       generate unique names server-side for storing files.
    4. Verify File Paths: Ensure files are being saved in the correct,
       intended directory, and prevent redirection to unauthorized directories.

    Example remediation:
    ```
      public class FileUploadHandler {

            protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
                  throws ServletException, IOException {

              Part filePart = request.getPart("file");
              String fileName = filePart.getSubmittedFileName();

              // removes any path information from the filename
              String sanitizedFileName = sanitizeFileName(fileName);
              if (!isFileNameAllowed(sanitizedFileName)) {
                  throw new SecurityException("Invalid file name");
              }

              // Generate a unique file name for storage
              String storedFileName = UUID.randomUUID().toString() + ".txt";

              Path targetPath = Paths.get("uploads").resolve(storedFileName);
              Files.copy(fileContent, targetPath, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);

          private String sanitizeFileName(String fileName) {
              return Paths.get(fileName).getFileName().toString();
          }

          private boolean isFileNameAllowed(String fileName) {

    A potential hard-coded password was identified in a hard-coded string.
    Passwords should not be stored directly in code

    when or if, a key is compromised.

    The recommendation on which KMS to use depends on the environment the application is running
    in:

    - For Google Cloud Platform consider [Cloud Key Management](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs)
    - For Amazon Web Services consider [AWS Key Management](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/)
    - For on premise or other alternatives to cloud providers, consider [Hashicorp's

  message: |
    HTTP Response Splitting is a vulnerability where Carriage Return (CR `\r`) and Line Feed (LF
    `\n`)
    characters are introduced into an HTTP header from user-supplied input. By injecting the
    `\r\n`
    character sequence, an adversary could potentially modify how the response is interpreted by
    the
    client or any down stream caching services. This could allow an adversary to poison the cache
    data or execute Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

    Some Java application servers such as [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) will
    automatically encode
    characters from being set in response headers as a space `0x20` character. If your application
    server does
    not automatically provide this functionality, user-supplied input that is used in header keys
    or values must be
    validated.

    Example of validating headers to only allow valid characters:
    ```
    // throws an IllegalArgumentException if the provided value contains invalid characters
    public void validateHeader(String value) throws IllegalArgumentException {
        char[] chars = value.toCharArray();

        // iterate over every character
        for (int i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
            char c = chars[i];

            // check for any characters below 0x21 as well as: '"' ',' ';' '\' and 0x7f.
            if (c < 0x21 || c == '"' || c == ',' || c == ';' || c == '\\' || c == 0x7f) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid character in cookie detected:
    {0}".format(Integer.toString(c)));
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    Alternatively, you could use a string escape package such as
    [Apache Commons Text](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/) to escape the input:
    ```
    public String escapeValue(String value) {
      return StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava(value);
    }
    ```

  message: |
    The application was found including unvalidated user input into a URL, which could lead to
    HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) or worse, Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This could
    allow an adversary to override the value of a URL or a request parameter.  HTTP Parameter
    Pollution
    (HPP) attacks consist of injecting encoded query string delimiters into other existing
    parameters. If a web
    application does not properly sanitize the user input, an adversary may modify the logic of
    these
    requests to other applications.

    To remediate this issue, never allow user input directly into creation of a URL or URL
    parameter. Consider
    using a map to look up user-supplied information and return exact values to be used in the
    generation of
    requests.

    Example using a map to look up a key to be used in a HTTP request:
    ```
    HashMap<String, String> lookupTable = new HashMap<>();
    lookupTable.put("key1", "value1");
    lookupTable.put("key2", "value2");
    String userInput = request.getParameter("key");

    // Create a CloseableHttpClient, ideally any requests issued should be done
    // out-of-band from the servlet request itself (such as using a separate thread/scheduler
    system)
    try (final CloseableHttpClient httpClient = HttpClients.createDefault()) {
        // Lookup the value from our user input from our lookupTable
        String value = lookupTable.getOrDefault(userInput, "value1");
        // Construct the url, with the hardcoded url and only pass in the value from the
    lookupTable,
        // not direct user input
        final HttpGet httpget = new HttpGet("https://example.com/getId?key="+value);
        // Execute the request
        CloseableHttpResponse clientResponse = httpClient.execute(httpget);
        // Read the response
        byte[] responseData = clientResponse.getEntity().getContent().readAllBytes();
        // Handle the response
        // ...
    }
    ```

    If using a map is not possible, the user-supplied input must be encoded prior to use, and
    never allow full
    URLs:
    ```
    // Get user input
    String userInput = request.getParameter("key");
    // Encode the string using java.net.URLEncoder with the UTF-8 character set
    String encodedString = java.net.URLEncoder.encode(userInput, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
    // Create a CloseableHttpClient, ideally any requests issued should be done
    // out-of-band from the servlet request itself (such as using a separate thread/scheduler
    system)
    try (final CloseableHttpClient httpClient = HttpClients.createDefault()) {
      // Construct the url, with the hardcoded url and only pass in the encoded value, never a
    full URL
      final HttpGet httpget = new HttpGet("https://example.com/getId?key="+encodedString);
      // Execute the request
      CloseableHttpResponse clientResponse = httpClient.execute(httpget);
      // Read the response
      byte[] responseData = clientResponse.getEntity().getContent().readAllBytes();
      // handle the response
    }
    ```

  message: |
    HTTP Response Splitting is a vulnerability where Carriage Return (CR `\r`) and Line Feed (LF
    `\n`)
    characters are introduced into an HTTP header from user-supplied input. By injecting the
    `\r\n`
    character sequence, an adversary could potentially modify how the response is interpreted by
    the
    client or any downstream caching services. This could allow an adversary to poison the cache
    data or execute Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

    Some Java application servers such as [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) as of version
    8.0, newer versions of Jetty and other servers that implement the [RFC 6265 Standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265) will
    disallow `\r' and '\n` characters characters from being set in cookies. If your application server does not
    automatically provide this functionality, user-supplied input that is used in cookie keys or
    values must be validated.

    Example of validating cookies to only allow valid characters:
    ```
    // throws an IllegalArgumentException if the provided value contains invalid characters
    public void validateRfc6265CookieValue(String value) throws IllegalArgumentException {
        char[] chars = value.toCharArray();

        // iterate over every character
        for (int i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
            char c = chars[i];

            // check for any characters below 0x21 as well as: '"' ',' ';' '\' and 0x7f.
            if (c < 0x21 || c == '"' || c == ',' || c == ';' || c == '\\' || c == 0x7f) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid character in cookie detected:
    {0}".format(Integer.toString(c)));
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    Alternatively, you could use a string escape package such as
    [Apache Commons Text](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/) to escape the input:
    ```
    public String escapeValue(String value) {
      return StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava(value);
    }
    ```

    LDAP injection attacks exploit LDAP queries to influence how data is returned by
    the LDAP server.

    Later versions of Java's `InitialDirContext.search` introduced a four argument method, one of
    which is the `filterArg` parameter. The `filterArg` will be automatically encoded when
    querying
    the LDAP server. If this method signature is not available, the application must encode the
    LDAP strings manually.

    More details on the four argument `search` method can be found here:
    https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/docs/api/java.naming/javax/naming/directory/InitialDirContext.html#search(javax.naming.Name,java.lang.String,java.lang.Object[],javax.naming.directory.SearchControls)

    To encode the string manually, it is recommended that all input passed to LDAP querying
    systems
    encode the following values:

    - Any occurrence of the null character must be escaped as “\00”.
    - Any occurrence of the open parenthesis character must be escaped as “\28”.
    - Any occurrence of the close parenthesis character must be escaped as “\29”.
    - Any occurrence of the asterisk character must be escaped as “\2a”.
    - Any occurrence of the backslash character must be escaped as “\5c”.

    Example function that safely encodes user-supplied input to be used in an LDAP query.
    ```
    public static String encodeLDAPString(String input) {
      // Note the \ character is replaced first
      CharSequence[] chars = new CharSequence[] { "\\", "\0", "(", ")", "*" };
      CharSequence[] encoded = new CharSequence[] { "\\5c", "\\00", "\\28", "\\29", "\\2a" };
      // Iterate over each character sequence, replacing the raw value with an encoded version of
    it
      for (int i = 0; i < chars.length; i++)
      {
          // re-assign to input
          input = input.replace(chars[i], encoded[i]);
      }
      // return our modified input string
      return input;
    }
    ```

    Example code that using the `filterArgs` parameter which automatically encodes for us:
    ```
    // Create a properties to hold the ldap connection details
    Properties props = new Properties();
    // Use the com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory factory provider
    props.put(Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY, "com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory");
    // The LDAP server URL
    props.put(Context.PROVIDER_URL, "ldap://ldap.example.org:3889");
    // User details for the connection
    props.put(Context.SECURITY_PRINCIPAL, "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org");
    // LDAP account password
    String ldapAccountPassword = getAccountPasswordFromSecureStoreOrKMS();
    // Pass in the LDAP password
    props.put(Context.SECURITY_CREDENTIALS, ldapAccountPassword);

    // Create the LDAPContext
    InitialDirContext ldapContext = new InitialDirContext(props);
    // Example using SUBTREE_SCOPE SearchControls
    SearchControls searchControls = new SearchControls();
    searchControls.setSearchScope(SearchControls.SUBTREE_SCOPE);

    // Get user input for query
    String userQuery = someUserInput;
    // Use searchArguments to hold the user-supplied input
    Object[] searchArguments = new Object[]{userQuery};
    // Hardcode the BaseDN, use the {0} format specifier to use the searchArguments array value,
    and pass in the search controls.
    // searchArguments automatically encode
    NamingEnumeration answer = ldapContext.search("dc=example,dc=org", "(cn={0})",
    searchArguments, searchControls);
    // Process the response answer
    while (answer.hasMoreElements()) {
      ...
    }
    ```

    The application was found matching a variable during a regular expression
    pattern match, and then calling string modification functions after validation has occurred.
    This is usually indicative of a poor input validation strategy as an adversary may attempt to
    exploit the removal of characters.

    For example a common mistake in attempting to remove path characters to protect against path
    traversal is to match '../' and then remove any matches. However, if an adversary were to
    include in their input: '....//' then the `replace`  method would replace the first `../` but
    cause the leading `..` and trailing `/` to join into the final string of `../`, effectively
    bypassing the check.

    To remediate this issue always perform string modifications before any validation of a string.
    It is strongly recommended that strings be encoded instead of replaced or removed prior to
    validation.


    Example replaces `..` before validation. Do note this is still not a recommended method for
    protecting against directory traversal, always use randomly generated IDs or filenames instead:
    ```
    // This is ONLY for demonstration purpose, never use untrusted input
    // in paths, always use randomly generated filenames or IDs.
    String input = "test../....//dir";
    // Use replaceAll _not_ replace
    input = input.replaceAll("\\.\\.", "");
    // Input would be test///dir at this point
    // Create a pattern to match on
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("\\.\\.");
    // Create a matcher
    Matcher match = pattern.matcher(input);
    // Call find to see if .. is still in our string
    if (match.find()) {
        throw new Exception(".. detected");
    }
    // Use the input (but do not modify the string)
    System.out.println(input + " safe");

    The Object Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) is an expression language that allows access to
    Java objects and properties stored in an ActionContext. Usage of these low-level
    functions is discouraged because they can effectively execute strings as code, leading to
    remote code execution vulnerabilities. Consider using struts tags when processing
    user-supplied input and templates.

    Much like the Struts security guide recommending to not use raw `${}` EL expressions,
    do not call or use the following OGNL packages with user-supplied input:

    - `com.opensymphony.xwork2.ognl`
    - `com.opensymphony.xwork2.util`
    - `com.opensymphony.xwork2.util.reflection`
    - `org.apache.struts2.util.StrutsUtil`

    The application was found setting file permissions to overly permissive values. Consider
    using the following values if the application user is the only process to access
    the file:

    - `r--` - read only access to the file
    - `w--` - write only access to the file
    - `rw-` - read/write access to the file

    Example setting read/write permissions for only the owner of a `Path`:
    ```
    // Get a reference to the path
    Path path = Paths.get("/tmp/somefile");
    // Create a PosixFilePermission set from java.nio.file.attribute
    Set<PosixFilePermission> permissions =
    java.nio.file.attribute.PosixFilePermissions.fromString("rw-------");
    // Set the permissions
    java.nio.file.Files.setPosixFilePermissions(path, permissions);
    ```

  message: |
    Cryptographic block ciphers can be configured to pad individual blocks if there is not enough
    input data to match the size of the block. This specific mode of CBC used in combination with
    PKCS5Padding is susceptible to padding oracle attacks. An adversary could potentially decrypt
    the message if the system exposed the difference between plaintext with invalid padding or
    valid padding. The distinction between valid and invalid padding is usually revealed through
    distinct error messages being returned for each condition.

    Consider switching to a more secure cipher that doesn't require padding and builds in message
    authentication integrity directly into the algorithm.

    Consider using `ChaCha20Poly1305` or
    `AES-256-GCM` instead.

    For older applications that don't have support for `ChaCha20Poly1305`, `AES-256-GCM` is
    recommended, however it has many drawbacks:
      - Slower than `ChaCha20Poly1305`.
      - Catastrophic failure if nonce values are reused.

    Example using `ChaCha20Poly1305`:
    ```
    public encrypt() throws Exception {
        chaChaEncryption("Secret text to encrypt".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
    }

    public SecureRandom getSecureRandomDRBG() throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {

    Prior to HTML5, Web browsers enforced the Same Origin Policy which ensures that in order for
    JavaScript to access the contents of a Web page, both the JavaScript and the Web page must
    originate from the same domain. Without the Same Origin Policy, a malicious website could serve
    up JavaScript that loads sensitive information from other websites using a client's
    credentials, cull through it, and communicate it back to the attacker. HTML5 makes it possible
    for JavaScript to access data across domains if a new HTTP header called
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin is defined. With this header, a Web server defines which other
    domains are allowed to access its domain using cross-origin requests. However, caution should
    be taken when defining the header because an overly permissive CORS policy will allow a
    malicious application to communicate with the victim application in an inappropriate way,
    leading to spoofing, data theft, relay and other attacks.

  message: |
    This application potentially allows user-supplied input into the value of the
    `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header. This header is part of the
    [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) CORS
    specification. By allowing user input to specify which domains can communicate with this
    server,
    an adversary could exploit a weakness in this server to force clients to send credentials (such
    as session
    identifiers) to the adversary's server.

    For the above attack to work, the application would need to suffer from an additional
    vulnerability,
    such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

    To remediate this issue, do not use user-supplied information when calling
    `HttpServletResponse.setHeader` or `HttpServletResponse.addHeader`
    for the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header's value. Instead, hardcode the allowed domain(s)
    and reference them in a lookup
    table:
    Example allowing dynamic but safe domains in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`:

    ```
      // this data should be in the class constructor or taken from a trusted datasource
      Map<String, String> allowedDomains = new HashMap();
      allowedDomains.put("sub1", "sub1.example.com");
      allowedDomains.put("sub2", "sub2.example.com");

      // extract the allowedDomain parameters value as a key to look up which domain to provide
    via the allowedDomains map
      // if not found, sets sub1 as the default
      String headerValue = allowedDomains.getOrDefault(request.getParameter("allowedDomain"),
    allowedDomains.get("sub1"));

      // add the header with our trusted sub1.example.com or sub2.example.com domains.
      response.addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", headerValue);
    }
    ```

    Depending on the context, generating weak random numbers may expose cryptographic functions
    which rely on these numbers, to be exploitable. When generating numbers for sensitive values
    such as tokens, nonces, and cryptographic keys, it is recommended that the `DRBG` instance

  message: |
    The application dynamically constructs file or path information. If the path
    information comes from user input, it could be abused to read sensitive files,
    access other users' data, or aid in exploitation to gain further system access.

    User input should never be used in constructing paths or files for interacting
    with the filesystem. This includes filenames supplied by user uploads or downloads.
    If possible, consider hashing user input or replacing it with unique values and
    use `Path.resolve` to resolve and validate the path information
    prior to processing any file functionality.

    Example using `Path.resolve` and not allowing direct user input:
    ```
    // Class to store our user data along with a randomly generated file name
    public static class UserData {
        private String userFileNameUnsafe;
        private String fileName;
        public UserData(String userFileName) {
            this.userFileNameUnsafe = userFileName;
            // Generate a random ID for the filename
            this.fileName = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
        }
        public String getUserFileNameUnsafe() { return userFileNameUnsafe; };
        public String getFileName() { return fileName; };
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // User input, saved only as a reference
        UserData userData = new UserData("..\\test.txt");
        // Restrict all file processing to this directory only
        String base = "/var/app/restricted";
        Path basePath = Paths.get(base);
        // Resolve the full path, but only use our random generated filename
        Path fullPath = basePath.resolve(userData.getFileName());
        // verify the path is contained within our basePath
        if (!fullPath.startsWith(base)) {
            throw new Exception("Invalid path specified!");
        }
        // process / work with file
    }

  message: |
    The `HttpRequest.getRequestDispatcher()`'s `include` and `forward` methods will return
    any file that is resolvable within the web application context. This includes the `web.xml`
    file, any compiled classes, `jsp` files, and additional JAR or WAR libraries that are
    accessible.

    Never pass user-supplied input directly to any of these methods. Use a lookup table or
    hardcode
    which views or paths the user should be directed to. Another option is to use a simple HTTP
    redirect by returning an empty response body with a 301 status code and a `Location` redirect
    header. In Java servlets, this can be done by using the `response.sendRedirect(...)` method.

    Example using a redirect instead of a `RequestDispatcher`:
    ```
    // Create a look up table or pull from a data source
    HashMap<String, String> lookupTable = new HashMap<>();
    lookupTable.put("key1", "/Resource1");
    lookupTable.put("key2", "/Resource2");
    // Get user input
    String userInput = request.getParameter("key");
    // Look up resource to redirect to from the user input
    String redirectValue = lookupTable.getOrDefault(userInput, "/Resource1");
    // Redirect the user

  message: |
    The `org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView` class and
    `HttpRequest.getRequestDispatcher()`'s `include` and `forward` methods may
    potentially allow access to restricted files if called with user-supplied input.

    For Spring MVC, the ModelAndView class looks up a view by name to resolve a `.jsp`
    file. If this view name comes from user-supplied input, it could be abused to attempt
    to return a JSP view that the user should not have access to.

    The `HttpRequest.getRequestDispatcher()`'s `include` and `forward` methods will return
    any file that is resolvable within the web application context. This includes the `web.xml`
    file, any compiled classes, `jsp` files, and additional JAR or WAR libraries that are
    accessible.

    Never pass user-supplied input directly to any of these methods. Use a lookup table or
    hardcode
    which views or paths the user should be directed to. Another option is to use a simple HTTP
    redirect by returning an empty response body with a 301 status code and a `Location` redirect
    header. In Java servlets, this can be done by using the `response.sendRedirect(...)` method.

    Example using a lookup table to resolve a view from a Spring MVC application:
    ```
    @RequestMapping(value="/mvc", method=RequestMethod.GET)
    public ModelAndView mvc(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Model model)
     {
      // Create a look up table or pull from a data source
      HashMap<String, String> lookupTable = new HashMap<>();
      lookupTable.put("key1", "view1");
      lookupTable.put("key2", "view2");
      // Get user input
      String userInput = request.getParameter("key");
      // Look up view from the user input
      String viewValue = lookupTable.getOrDefault(userInput, userInput);
      // return the new model and view
      return new ModelAndView(viewValue);
    }
    ```

    Example using a redirect instead of a `RequestDispatcher`:
    ```
    // Create a look up table or pull from a data source
    HashMap<String, String> lookupTable = new HashMap<>();
    lookupTable.put("key1", "/Resource1");
    lookupTable.put("key2", "/Resource2");
    // Get user input
    String userInput = request.getParameter("key");
    // Look up resource to redirect to from the user input
    String redirectValue = lookupTable.getOrDefault(userInput, "/Resource1");
    // Redirect the user
    response.sendRedirect(redirectValue);
    ```

  message: |
    The application is generating an RSA key that is less than the recommended 2048 bits.
    The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) deprecated signing Digital
    Certificates that contained RSA Public Keys of 1024 bits in December 2010. While
    1024-bit RSA keys have not been factored yet, advances in compute may make it possible
    in the near future.

    Consider upgrading to the newer asymmetric algorithm such as `Ed25519` which handles
    the complexities of generating key pairs and choosing correct key sizes for you:
    ```
    public static KeyPair generateEd25519() throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        // Choose Ed25519 for KeyPairGenerator Instance
        KeyPairGenerator keyPairGenerator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("Ed25519");
        // Generate a KeyPair and return
        return keyPairGenerator.generateKeyPair();
    }
    ```

    Otherwise use a key size greater than 2048 when generating RSA keys:
    ```
    public static KeyPair generateRSA() throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {
        // Choose RSA for KeyPairGenerator Instance
        KeyPairGenerator keyPairGenerator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("RSA");
        // Initialize with 2048 key size
        keyPairGenerator.initialize(2048);
        // Generate a KeyPair and return
        return keyPairGenerator.generateKeyPair();
    }
    ```

    The software uses the RSA algorithm but does not incorporate Optimal Asymmetric
    Encryption Padding (OAEP). By not enabling padding, the algorithm maybe vulnerable

    method.

        // Generate an RSA Public and Private Key Pair
        KeyPair keyPair = generateRSAKeys();
        // Create a Cipher instance using RSA, ECB with OAEP
        Cipher rsaEncryptor = Cipher.getInstance("RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding");
        // Initialize to ENCRYPT_MODE with the public key
        rsaEncryptor.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, keyPair.getPublic());
        // Encrypt our secret message
        byte[] cipherText = rsaEncryptor.doFinal("Some secret
    message".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));

        // Create a Cipher instance using RSA, ECB with OAEP
        Cipher rsaDecryptor = Cipher.getInstance("RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding");
        // Initialize to DECRYPT_MODE with the private key
        rsaDecryptor.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, keyPair.getPrivate());
        // Decrypt the secret message
        byte[] plainText = rsaDecryptor.doFinal(cipherText);
        // Debug output

    The application was found calling SpringFramework's `SpelExpressionParser.parseExpression`.
    Calling this method directly with user-supplied input may allow an adversary to
    execute arbitrary Java code including OS system commands.

    Never call `parseExpression` or `parseRaw` directly with user-supplied input. Consider
    alternate
    methods such as a lookup table to take user input and resolve hardcoded values.

    Later versions of SpringFramework introduced a `SimpleEvaluationContext` which can be
    used to access bound data when calling the `getValue` result of `parseExpression`. This
    `SimpleEvaluationContext` has a reduced set of functionality and can restrict data binding
    to read-only or read-write contexts. An adversary could still access public properties
    or fields on custom types that have been provided to the evaluation context. Use with caution.

    Example using `SimpleEvaluationContext` with a read-write data binding context:
    ```
    @RequestMapping(value="/spel", method=RequestMethod.POST)
    public String spel(@Validated User user, Model model)  {
      // Create the Expression Parser
      SpelExpressionParser parser = new SpelExpressionParser();
      // Parse the expression

  message: |
    The application was found calling `MimeMessage` methods without encoding
    new line characters. Much like HTTP, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a
    text based protocol that uses headers to convey additional directives for how
    email messages should be treated. An adversary could potentially cause email
    messages to be sent to unintended recipients by abusing the CC or BCC headers
    if they were able to inject them.

    To mitigate this issue, `\r\n` (CRLF) character sequences must be escaped
    or encoded prior to being used in any of the `MimeMessage` methods.

    Example that escapes values that come from user input with
    [Apache Commons Text](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/):
    ```
    // Create a MimeMessage with a javax.mail.Session
    Message message = new MimeMessage(session);
    // Set the from address
    message.setFrom(new InternetAddress("source@example.com"));
    // Set the to address
    message.setRecipients(Message.RecipientType.TO,new InternetAddress[] {new
    InternetAddress("destination@example.com")});
    // Example user input
    String subject = "potentially malicious data";
    String headerValue = "potentially malicious data";
    // Use Apache Commons Text StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava to encode \r\n to \\r\\n.
    message.setSubject(StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava(subject));
    // Use Apache Commons Text StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava to encode \r\n to \\r\\n.
    message.addHeader("HeaderName", StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava(header));
    // Use Apache Commons Text StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava to encode \r\n to \\r\\n.
    message.setDescription(StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava("some description"));
    // Use Apache Commons Text StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava to encode \r\n to \\r\\n.
    message.setDisposition(StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava("some disposition"));
    // Set the mail body text
    message.setText("Some email content.");
    // Send the message

  message: |
    The application fails to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
    due to disabling Spring's CSRF protection features.

    The vulnerability can be exploited by an adversary creating a link or form on a third
    party site and tricking an authenticated victim to access them.

    To remediate this issue, remove the call to `HttpSecurity.csrf().disable()` or remove
    the custom `CsrfConfigurer`.

    For more information on CSRF protection in Spring see:
    https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/exploits/csrf.html#servlet-csrf

    Additionally, consider setting all session cookies to have the `SameSite=Strict` attribute.
    It should be noted that this may impact usability when sharing links across other mediums.
    It is recommended that a two cookie based approach is taken, as outlined in the
    [Top level
    navigations](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-08#section-8.8.2)
    section
    of the SameSite RFC.

  message: |
    The `org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView` class may
    potentially allow access to restricted files if called with user-supplied input.

    The ModelAndView class looks up a view by name to resolve a `.jsp`
    file. If this view name comes from user-supplied input, it could be abused to attempt
    to return a JSP view that the user should not have access to.

    Use a lookup table or hardcode which views or paths the user should be directed to.

    Example using a lookup table to resolve a view from a Spring MVC application:
    ```
    @RequestMapping(value="/mvc", method=RequestMethod.GET)
    public ModelAndView mvc(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Model model)
     {
      // Create a look up table or pull from a data source
      HashMap<String, String> lookupTable = new HashMap<>();
      lookupTable.put("key1", "view1");
      lookupTable.put("key2", "view2");
      // Get user input
      String userInput = request.getParameter("key");
      // Look up view from the user input
      String viewValue = lookupTable.getOrDefault(userInput, "Resource1");
      // return the new model and view
      return new ModelAndView(viewValue);
    }
    ```

    Example using a redirect instead of a `RequestDispatcher` in Spring:
    ```
    @RequestMapping(value="/mvc", method=RequestMethod.GET)
    public void mvc(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, Model model)
     {
      // Create a look up table or pull from a data source
      HashMap<String, String> lookupTable = new HashMap<>();
      lookupTable.put("key1", "view1");
      lookupTable.put("key2", "view2");
      // Get user input
      String userInput = request.getParameter("key");
      // Look up resource to redirect to from the user input
      String redirectValue = lookupTable.getOrDefault(userInput, "/Resource1");
      // return the new model and view
      response.sendRedirect(redirectValue);
    }

  message: |
    SQL Injection is a critical vulnerability that can lead to data or system compromise. By
    dynamically generating SQL query strings, user input may be able to influence the logic of
    the SQL statement. This could lead to an adversary accessing information they should
    not have access to, or in some circumstances, being able to execute OS functionality or code.

    Replace all dynamically generated SQL queries with parameterized queries. In situations where
    dynamic queries must be created, never use direct user input, but instead use a map or
    dictionary of valid values and resolve them using a user supplied key.

    For example, some database drivers do not allow parameterized queries for `>` or `<` comparison
    operators. In these cases, do not use a user supplied `>` or `<` value, but rather have the
    user
    supply a `gt` or `lt` value. The alphabetical values are then used to look up the `>` and `<`
    values to be used in the construction of the dynamic query. The same goes for other queries
    where
    column or table names are required but cannot be parameterized.

    Example using `PreparedStatement` queries:
    ```
    // Some userInput
    String userInput = "someUserInput";
    // Your connection string
    String url = "...";
    // Get a connection from the DB via the DriverManager
    Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url);
    // Create a prepared statement
    PreparedStatement st = conn.prepareStatement("SELECT name FROM table where name=?");
    // Set each parameters value by the index (starting from 1)
    st.setString(1, userInput);
    // Execute query and get the result set
    ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery();
    // Iterate over results
    while (rs.next()) {
        // Get result for this row at the provided column number (starting from 1)
        String result = rs.getString(1);
        // ...
    }
    // Close the ResultSet
    rs.close();
    // Close the PreparedStatement
    st.close();
    ```

  message: |
    The application was found enabling insecure TLS protocol versions. When enabling protocol
    versions for an `SSLContext`, only the following versions should be allowed:
    - TLSv1.2
    - TLSv1.3
    - DTLSv1.2
    - DTLSv1.3

    To mitigate potential security risks, it is strongly advised to enforce TLS 1.2 as the minimum
    protocol version and disallow older versions such as TLS 1.0. Do note that newer versions of
    Java do not even support TLS 1.0 and will throw `NoSuchAlgorithmException`. Versions of TLS
    prior to 1.2 could expose the connection to downgrade attacks, where an adversary intercepts
    the
    connection and alters the requested protocol version to be a less secure one.

    In many scenarios, relying on the default system configuration does not meet compliance
    standards. This is due to the application being deployed across diverse systems with varying
    configurations and Java versions. While the default value may be secure on modern and
    up-to-date systems, it may not hold true for older systems. Consequently, it is highly
    recommended to explicitly define a secure configuration in all cases.

    Example configuring an SSLContext with TLSv1.2:
    ```
    // Create an SSLContext with TLSv1.2 explicitly
    SSLContext tlsContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLSv1.2"); // or TLSv1.3, DTLSv1.2, DTLSv1.3

    // Alternatively, set the enabled protocols
    SSLContext serverSslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
    SSLEngine serverEngine = serverSslContext.createSSLEngine();
    // Calling setEnabledProtocols will override the original context's configured protocol version
    serverEngine.setEnabledProtocols(new String[]{ "TLSv1.2" });
    ```

    dynamically creating template strings may allow an adversary to execute arbitrary Java code,

    For Velocity, never call `evaluate` with user-supplied input in the template string. Use a
    `VelocityContext`
    object instead to data-bind user-supplied information as it will be treated as an underlying
    data type and not
    template code.

    Example using Apache Velocity's `VelocityContext` and escape tools to pass in user-supplied
    data to a template:
    ```
    // Create a tool manager
    ToolManager manager = new ToolManager(true);
    // Create a context from the tool manager
    Context context = manager.createContext();
    // For demonstration purposes, alternatively configure from a properties file

  message: |
    Server-Side-Request-Forgery (SSRF) exploits backend systems that initiate requests to third
    parties.
    If user input is used in constructing or sending these requests, an attacker could supply
    malicious
    data to force the request to other systems or modify request data to cause unwanted actions.

    Ensure user input is not used directly in constructing URLs or URIs when initiating requests
    to third party
    systems from back end systems. Care must also be taken when constructing payloads using user
    input. Where
    possible restrict to known URIs or payloads. Consider using a server-side map where keys are
    used to return
    URLs such as `https://site/goto?key=1` where `{key: 1, url: 'http://some.url/', key: 2, url:
    'http://...'}`.

    If you must use user-supplied input for requesting URLs, it is strongly recommended that the
    HTTP client
    chosen allows you to customize and block certain IP ranges at the network level. By blocking
    RFC 1918
    addresses or other network address ranges, you can limit the severity of a successful SSRF
    attack. Care must
    also be taken to block certain protocol or address formatting such as IPv6.

    If you cannot block address ranges at the client level, you may want to run the HTTP client
    as a protected
    user, or in a protected network where you can apply IP Table or firewall rules to block access
    to dangerous
    addresses. Finally, if none of the above protections are available, you could also run a
    custom HTTP proxy
    and force all requests through it to handle blocking dangerous addresses.

    Example using a map to look up a key to be used in a HTTP request:
    ```
    HashMap<String, String> lookupTable = new HashMap<>();
    lookupTable.put("key1", "https://example.com/");
    lookupTable.put("key2", "https://safeurl.com/");
    String userInput = request.getParameter("key");

    // Create a CloseableHttpClient, ideally any requests issued should be done
    // out-of-band from the servlet request itself (such as using a separate thread/scheduler
    system)
    try (final CloseableHttpClient httpClient = HttpClients.createDefault()) {
        // Lookup the value from our user input from our lookupTable
        String value = lookupTable.getOrDefault(userInput, "https://example.com/");
        // Construct the url, with the hardcoded url and only pass in the value from the
    lookupTable,
        // not direct user input
        final HttpGet httpget = new HttpGet(value);
        // Execute the request
        CloseableHttpResponse clientResponse = httpClient.execute(httpget);
        // Read the response
        byte[] responseData = clientResponse.getEntity().getContent().readAllBytes();
        // Handle the response
        // ...
    }
    ```

    If using a map is not possible, the user-supplied input must be encoded prior to use, and
    never allow full
    URLs:
    ```
    // Get user input
    String userInput = request.getParameter("key");
    // Encode the string using java.net.URLEncoder with the UTF-8 character set
    String encodedString = java.net.URLEncoder.encode(userInput, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
    // Create a CloseableHttpClient, ideally any requests issued should be done
    // out-of-band from the servlet request itself (such as using a separate thread/scheduler
    system)
    try (final CloseableHttpClient httpClient = HttpClients.createDefault()) {
      // Construct the url, with the hardcoded url and only pass in the encoded value, never a
    full URL
      final HttpGet httpget = new HttpGet("https://example.com/getId?key="+encodedString);
      // Execute the request
      CloseableHttpResponse clientResponse = httpClient.execute(httpget);
      // Read the response
      byte[] responseData = clientResponse.getEntity().getContent().readAllBytes();
      // handle the response
    }
    ```

  message: |
    Either the `HostnameVerifier` has been set to always return `true` or the `X509TrustManager`
    has

    This allows for an adversary who is in between the application and the target host to intercept
    potentially sensitive information or transmit malicious data.

    It is recommended to not override the default `HostnameVerifiers`.

    Consider using the default `TrustManager` instead of implementing a custom one. If you must
    override
    the default verification process, implement proper TrustManager verification for
    `checkServerTrusted` and
    `checkClientTrusted` by throwing `CertificateException` if the certificate is invalid.

    Example using the built in `TrustManagerFactory` to manage validating certificate chains:
    ```
    // Use the default TrustManagerFactory
    TrustManagerFactory trustManagerFactory =
    TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(TrustManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());
    // Use default system KeyStore, alternatively pass in your own keystore.
    trustManagerFactory.init((KeyStore) null);
    // Create SSLContext for TLS connections
    SSLContext tlsContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
    // Initialize the tlsContext with our trust manager and a SecureRandom number generator.
    tlsContext.init(null, trustManagerFactory.getTrustManagers(), new SecureRandom());

  message: "The `X509TrustManager` has been configured to return null. This effectively

    Man in the middle attack (MITM) i.e \nintercept potentially sensitive information
    or inject malicious content into the \ncommunication stream.\n\nConsider using

    provided by the Java runtime is \nsufficient and recommended. Following is an
    example using the built in `TrustManagerFactory` \nto manage validating certificate
    chains:\n```\n// Use the default TrustManagerFactory\nTrustManagerFactory trustManagerFactory

    Use default system KeyStore, alternatively pass in your own keystore.\ntrustManagerFactory.init((KeyStore)

    Initialize the tlsContext with our trust manager and a SecureRandom number generator.\ntlsContext.init(null,

    The application is disabling Wicket's string escaping functionality by calling
    `setEscapeModelStrings(false)`.
    This could lead to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) if used with user-supplied input. XSS is an
    attack which exploits
     a web application or system to treat    user input
    as markup or script code. It is important to encode the data depending on the specific context
    it
    is used in. There are at least six context types:

    - Inside HTML tags `<div>context 1</div>`
    - Inside attributes: `<div class="context 2"></div>`
    - Inside event attributes `<button onclick="context 3">button</button>`
    - Inside script blocks: `<script>var x = "context 4"</script>`
    - Unsafe element HTML assignment: `element.innerHTML = "context 5"`
    - Inside URLs: `<iframe src="context 6"></iframe><a href="context 6">link</a>`

    Script blocks alone have multiple ways they need to be encoded. Extra care must be taken if
    user input
    is ever output inside of script tags.

    User input that is displayed within the application must be encoded, sanitized or validated
    to ensure it cannot be treated as HTML or executed as JavaScript code. Care must also be
    taken
    to not mix server-side templating with client-side templating, as the server-side templating
    will
    not encode things like {{ 7*7 }} which may execute client-side templating features.

    It is _NOT_ advised to encode user input prior to inserting into a data store. The data will
    need to be
    encoded depending on context of where it is output. It is much safer to force the displaying
    system to
    handle the encoding and not attempt to guess how it should be encoded.

    Use Wicket's built in escaping feature by calling `Component.setEscapeModelStrings(true);`

  message: |
    Deserialization attacks exploit the process of reading serialized data and turning it back
    into an object. By constructing malicious objects and serializing them, an adversary may
    attempt to:

    - Inject code that is executed upon object construction, which occurs during the
    deserialization process.
    - Exploit mass assignment by including fields that are not normally a part of the serialized
    data but are read in during deserialization.

    Consider safer alternatives such as serializing data in the JSON format. Ensure any format
    chosen allows
    the application to specify exactly which object types are allowed to be deserialized.
    Additionally, when
    deserializing, never deserialize to base object types like `Object` and only cast to the exact
    object
    type that is expected.

    To protect against mass assignment, only allow deserialization of the specific fields that are
    required. If this is not easily done, consider creating an intermediary type that
    can be serialized with only the necessary fields exposed.

    Do note that `XMLEncoder` and `XMLDecoder` are not recommended. If the application must
    use this serialization method, use a custom ClassLoader to prevent loading of arbitrary
    classes:
    ```
    XMLDecoder decoder = new XMLDecoder(inputStream, null, null, new ClassLoader() {
        @Override
        protected Class<?> loadClass(String name, boolean resolve) throws ClassNotFoundException {
            if (!name.equals(NameOfBeanHere.class.getName()) &&
    !name.equals(XMLDecoder.class.getName())) {
                throw new RuntimeException("Unauthorized deserialization attempt: " + name);
            }

            return super.loadClass(name, resolve);
        }
    });
    ```

    For more information on XML security see OWASP's guide:
    https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#java

    For more details on deserialization attacks in general, see OWASP's guide:

    It should be noted that [tools exist](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial) to

    exploit code for these vulnerabilities.

  message: |
    The application processes `XPath` queries with potentially malicious input.
    An adversary who is able to control the XPath query could potentially influence the logic
    of how data is retrieved, processed or even bypass protections.

    To protect against XPath injection, user input should be parameterized using a variable
    resolver.
    By creating a class that implements the `XPathVariableResolver` the application can ensure
    that
    the xpath query and user-supplied input are treated separately.

    Example implementation of an XPathVariableResolver:
    ```
    // Create a class which implements the XPathVariableResolver interface
    public static class SimpleXPathVariableResolver implements XPathVariableResolver {
      // Use a map or lookup table to store variables for resolution
      private HashMap<QName, String> variables = new HashMap<>();
      // Allow caller to set variables
      public void setVariable(QName name, String value) {
        variables.put(name, value);
      }
      // Implement the resolveVariable to return the value
      @Override
      public Object resolveVariable(QName name) {
        return variables.getOrDefault(name, "");
      }
    }

    public static void xpathQuery(String userInput) throws ParseException,
    ParserConfigurationException,
      SAXException, IOException, XPathExpressionException {

      // Create our DocumentFactory
      DocumentBuilderFactory domFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
      // Enable namespace awareness
      domFactory.setNamespaceAware(true);
      // Enable secure processing
      domFactory.setFeature(XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING, true);
      // Create our DocumentBuilder
      DocumentBuilder builder = domFactory.newDocumentBuilder();
      // Parse our XML document
      Document doc = builder.parse("inventory.xml");

      // Create a new instance of an XPath object
      XPath xpathProcessor = XPathFactory.newInstance().newXPath();
      // Create our XPathVariableResolver
      SimpleXPathVariableResolver resolver = new SimpleXPathVariableResolver();
      // Add user input as a variable value
      resolver.setVariable(new QName("author"), userInput);
      // Configure the processor to use our variable resolver
      xpathProcessor.setXPathVariableResolver(resolver);
      // Evaluate the XPath query
          String result = xpathProcessor.compile("//author[contains(., $author)]").evaluate(doc);

    input
    that is used in the sendError method:

    Example using [Apache Commons Text](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/)
    `StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml4`:
    ```
    // Get user input
    String userInput = request.getParameter("key");
    // Encode the input using the Html4 encoder
    String encoded = StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml4(userInput);
    // Respond with the error code and value
    response.sendError(401, encoded);

  message: |
    The application is returning user-supplied data from an HTTP request directly into an HTTP
    response output
    writer. This could lead to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) if the input were malicious
    script code and the application server is not properly validating the output.

    XSS is an attack which exploits a web application or system to treat user input
    as markup or script code. It is important to encode the data depending on the specific context
    it is used in. There are at least six context types:

    - Inside HTML tags `<div>context 1</div>`
    - Inside attributes: `<div class="context 2"></div>`
    - Inside event attributes `<button onclick="context 3">button</button>`
    - Inside script blocks: `<script>var x = "context 4"</script>`
    - Unsafe element HTML assignment: `element.innerHTML = "context 5"`
    - Inside URLs: `<iframe src="context 6"></iframe><a href="context 6">link</a>`

    Script blocks alone have multiple ways they need to be encoded. Extra care must be taken if
    user input
    is ever output inside of script tags.

    User input that is displayed within the application must be encoded, sanitized or validated
    to ensure it cannot be treated as HTML or executed as Javascript code. Care must also be
    taken
    to not mix server-side templating with client-side templating, as the server-side templating
    will
    not encode things like {{ 7*7 }} which may execute client-side templating features.

    It is _NOT_ advised to encode user input prior to inserting into a data store. The data will
    need to be
    encoded depending on context of where it is output. It is much safer to force the displaying
    system to
    handle the encoding and not attempt to guess how it should be encoded.

    If possible do not use user input directly in the output to the response writer.

    If the application must output user-supplied input, it will need to encode the data depending
    on
    the output context.

    Consider using [Apache Commons Text](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/)
    `StringEscapeUtils` methods for various context. Please note there is no way to safely
    output script code in most circumstances, regardless of encoding. If calling the HTTP
    response writer directly, ensure that the `Content-Type` is set to `text/plain` so it will
    not be accidentally interpreted by HTML by modern browsers.
    ```
    // Get user input
    String htmlInput = request.getParameter("userInput");
    // Encode the input using the Html4 encoder
    String htmlEncoded = StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml4(htmlInput);
    // Force the HTTP response to be content type of text/plain so it is not interpreted as HTML
    response.setContentType("text/plain");
    // Ensure UTF-8
    response.setCharacterEncoding("UTF-8");
    // Write response
    response.getWriter().write(htmlEncoded);
    ```

    In most XML parsers, the recommendation to protect against XXE is to disable the doctype
    feature.
    Unfortunately use of the `XMLInputFactory` requires that the doctypes feature be enabled.
    Instead
    the application can set the `ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD` to an empty string and disable
    `javax.xml.stream.isSupportingExternalEntities`.


    Creates an `XMLInputFactory` stream parser, but disables accessing external DTD or entities:
    ```
    // Create an XMLInputFactory
    XMLInputFactory factory = XMLInputFactory.newFactory();
    // Set the ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD property to an empty string so it won't access
    // entities using protocols
    // (ref:
    https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/xml/XMLConstants.html#ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD)
    factory.setProperty(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD, "");
    // Additionally, disable support for resolving external entities
    factory.setProperty("javax.xml.stream.isSupportingExternalEntities", false);
    // Continue to work with the factory/stream parser

  message: |
    A potential hard-coded password was identified in the source code.
    Passwords should not be stored directly in code
    but loaded from secure locations such as a Key Management System (KMS).

    The purpose of using a Key Management System is so access can be audited and keys easily
    rotated
    in the event of a breach. By hardcoding passwords, it will be extremely difficult to determine
    when or if, a key is compromised.

    The recommendation on which KMS to use depends on the environment the application is running
    in:

    - For Google Cloud Platform consider [Cloud Key Management](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs)
    - For Amazon Web Services consider [AWS Key Management](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/)
    - For on premise or other alternatives to cloud providers, consider [Hashicorp's
    Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)
    - For other cloud providers, please see their documentation

  message: |
    Prior to HTML5, Web browsers enforced the Same Origin Policy which ensures that in order for
    JavaScript to access the contents of a Web page, both the JavaScript and the Web page must
    originate from the same domain. Without the Same Origin Policy, a malicious website could serve
    up JavaScript that loads sensitive information from other websites using a client's
    credentials, cull through it, and communicate it back to the attacker. HTML5 makes it possible
    for JavaScript to access data across domains if a new HTTP header called
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin is defined. With this header, a Web server defines which other
    domains are allowed to access its domain using cross-origin requests. However, caution should
    be taken when defining the header because an overly permissive CORS policy will allow a
    malicious application to communicate with the victim application in an inappropriate way,
    leading to spoofing, data theft, relay and other attacks.

  message: |
    The application was found enabling insecure TLS protocol versions. When enabling protocol
    versions for an `SSLContext`, only the following versions should be allowed:
    - TLSv1.2
    - TLSv1.3
    - DTLSv1.2
    - DTLSv1.3

    To mitigate potential security risks, it is strongly advised to enforce TLS 1.2 as the minimum
    protocol version and disallow older versions such as TLS 1.0. Do note that newer versions of
    Java do not even support TLS 1.0 and will throw `NoSuchAlgorithmException`. Versions of TLS
    prior to 1.2 could expose the connection to downgrade attacks, where an adversary intercepts
    the
    connection and alters the requested protocol version to be a less secure one.

    In many scenarios, relying on the default system configuration does not meet compliance
    standards. This is due to the application being deployed across diverse systems with varying
    configurations and Java versions. While the default value may be secure on modern and
    up-to-date systems, it may not hold true for older systems. Consequently, it is highly
    recommended to explicitly define a secure configuration in all cases.

    Example configuring an SSLContext with TLSv1.2:
    ```
    // Create an SSLContext with TLSv1.2 explicitly
    SSLContext tlsContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLSv1.2"); // or TLSv1.3, DTLSv1.2, DTLSv1.3

    // Alternatively, set the enabled protocols
    SSLContext serverSslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
    SSLEngine serverEngine = serverSslContext.createSSLEngine();
    // Calling setEnabledProtocols will override the original context's configured protocol version
    serverEngine.setEnabledProtocols(new String[]{ "TLSv1.2" });
    ```

    When data from an untrusted source is put into a logger and not neutralized correctly, an
    attacker could forge log entries or include malicious content. Inserted false entries could be

    Prior to HTML5, Web browsers enforced the Same Origin Policy which ensures that in order for
    JavaScript to access the contents of a Web page, both the JavaScript and the Web page must
    originate from the same domain. Without the Same Origin Policy, a malicious website could serve
    up JavaScript that loads sensitive information from other websites using a client's
    credentials, cull through it, and communicate it back to the attacker. HTML5 makes it possible
    for JavaScript to access data across domains if a new HTTP header called
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin is defined. With this header, a Web server defines which other
    domains are allowed to access its domain using cross-origin requests. However, caution should
    be taken when defining the header because an overly permissive CORS policy will allow a
    malicious application to communicate with the victim application in an inappropriate way,
    leading to spoofing, data theft, relay and other attacks.

  languages:

  message: |
    A trust boundary can be thought of as line drawn through a program. On one side
    of the line, data is untrusted. On the other side of the line, data is assumed
    to be trustworthy. The purpose of validation logic is to allow data to safely
    cross the trust boundary - to move from untrusted to trusted. A trust boundary
    violation occurs when a program blurs the line between what is trusted and what
    is untrusted. By combining trusted and untrusted data in the same data
    structure, it becomes easier for programmers to mistakenly trust unvalidated
    data.

  languages:

  message: |
    The `GetTempFileName` function works by generating a randomly named file, creating the file
    (if it does not exist) and then closing it. An application wishing to use this temporary file
    will need to reopen this file to begin working with it. This leads to a potential
    Time Of Check Time Of Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability, as an attacker could replace or modify
    the contents of the file prior to it being used by the application.

    Consider generating a random filename and opening the file directly in a single `CreateFile`
    or `OpenFile` call.

    The `LoadLibrary` function is used to load DLLs dynamically. Depending on the filepath
    parameter,
    the OS version, and the modes set for the process prior to calling LoadLibrary, DLL hijacking
    may
    be possible. Attackers can exploit this by placing DLL files with the same name in directories
    that
    are searched before the legitimate DLL is.

    To assist in preventing against this class of vulnerability consider:
    - Specifying a fully qualified path when using LoadLibraryEx.
    - Use the `LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH` flags with LoadLibraryEx or with SetDefaultDllDirectories.
    - If you use SetDefaultDllDirectories, be sure to use the AddDllDirectory or SetDllDirectory
      functions to modify the list of directories.
    - Only use `SearchPath` if the `SetSearchPathMode` function is called with
      `BASE_SEARCH_PATH_ENABLE_SAFE_SEARCHMODE`. (Note: this only moves the current directory to
      the end of the SearchPath search list.)

    Usage of the `access` function call hints at a potential Time Of Check Time Of Use (TOCTOU)
    vulnerability. Using the `access` function to check if a file exists and is readable before
    opening it, an attacker can create a race condition between the `access` call and
    opening the file. The attacker could replace the file with a different one or modify its
    content between the time the `access` function is called and the file is opened, thus
    bypassing the permission check.

    Call `setuid` to drop privileges on the process prior to opening any files. Instead of using
    `access`, use `lstat` prior to opening the file and confirm the attributes are correct. Then
    use `open` to get a file descriptor to this file. Call `fstat` on the `open` file descriptor
    to confirm that `st_dev` and `st_ino` are equal between the two. If they are, it is safe to
    read and operate on the file's contents.

    from the 1990 version.  Also, if passed a non-null parameter, there's a risk of a buffer

    This function is obsolete and not portable. It was in SUSv2 but removed by POSIX.2. What
    it does exactly varies considerably between systems, particularly in where its prompt is
    displayed and where it gets its data. Some systems will write to stderr instead of stdout.
    Some will read from stdin if it can not be read from /dev/tty. In some systems the
    buffer is static and limited to 127 characters, meaning the full password may not be returned
    properly.

    If you want to read input without terminal echoing enabled, see the description of the ECHO
    flag
    in the termios manual pager. If you ever read passwords from a terminal, be sure to zero the
    password as soon as possible, to avoid leaving the cleartext password visible in the
    process' address space.

    The gets() function reads a line from stdin into the provided buffer

    Usage of `fgets()` is not recommended for reading binary based files or inputs,

    Instead of using `readlink`, use `lstat` prior to opening the file and confirm the attributes

    Format string vulnerabilities allow an attacker to read or in some cases, potentially write
    data to
    and from locations in the processes' memory. To prevent against format string attacks, do not
    allow
    users or un-validated input to provide the format specification.
    Consider using a constant for the format specification, or strip all format
    specifiers from the input prior to calling the `snprintf` family of functions.

    Note that some variations of this function do not always null terminate the strings.

  message: |
    OS command injection is a critical vulnerability that can lead to a full system
    compromise as it may allow an adversary to pass in arbitrary commands or arguments
    to be executed.

    User input should never be used in constructing commands or command arguments
    to functions which execute OS commands. This includes filenames supplied by
    user uploads or downloads.

    Ensure your application does not:

    - Use user-supplied information in the process name to execute.
    - Use user-supplied information in an OS command execution function which does
    not escape shell meta-characters.
    - Use user-supplied information in arguments to OS commands.

    The application should have a hardcoded set of arguments that are to be passed
    to OS commands. If filenames are being passed to these functions, it is
    recommended that a hash of the filename be used instead, or some other unique
    identifier. It is strongly recommended that a native library that implements
    the same functionality be used instead of using OS system commands, due to the
    risk of unknown attacks against third party commands.

    When specifying the OS command, ensure the application uses the full path
    information, otherwise the OS may attempt to look up which process to execute
    and could be vulnerable to untrusted search path vulnerabilities (CWE-426).

    Example of safely executing an OS command:
    ```
    public void ExecuteCommand(string userFileData) {
        // generate a random filename, do not using user input
        string fileName = "C:\\Temp\\" + Guid.NewGuid();
        File.WriteAllText(fileName, userFileData);

        using (Process process = new Process())
        {
            // hardcode the full process path
            ProcessStartInfo processInfo = new ProcessStartInfo("C:\\App\\FileReader.exe");
            // only pass in trust arguments, and never direct user input.
            processInfo.Arguments = fileName;
            processInfo.UseShellExecute = false;
            process.StartInfo = processInfo;
            process.Start();
        }
    }
    ```

  message: |
    SQL Injection is a critical vulnerability that can lead to data or system compromise. By
    dynamically generating SQL query strings, user input may be able to influence the logic of
    the SQL statement. This could lead to an adversary accessing information they should
    not have access to, or in some circumstances, being able to execute OS functionality or code.

    Replace all dynamically generated SQL queries with parameterized queries. In situations where
    dynamic queries must be created, never use direct user input, but instead use a map or
    dictionary of valid values and resolve them using a user supplied key.

    For example, some database drivers do not allow parameterized queries for `>` or `<` comparison
    operators. In these cases, do not use a user supplied `>` or `<` value, but rather have the
    user
    supply a `gt` or `lt` value. The alphabetical values are then used to look up the `>` and `<`
    values to be used in the construction of the dynamic query. The same goes for other queries
    where
    column or table names are required but cannot be parameterized.

    Example using parameterized queries with `SqlCommand`:
    ```
    string userInput = "someUserInput";
    string connectionString = ...;
    using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
    {
        connection.Open();
        String sql = "SELECT name, value FROM table where name=@Name";

        using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(sql, connection))
        {
            command.Parameters.Add("@Name", System.Data.SqlDbType.NVarChar);
            command.Parameters["@Name"].Value = userInput;
            using (SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader())
            {
                while (reader.Read())
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("{0} {1}", reader.GetString(0), reader.GetString(1));
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    XPath injection is a vulnerability that can allow an adversary to inject or modify how an XML
    query
    is structured. Depending on the logic of the original query, this could lead to adversaries
    extracting unauthorized information or in rare cases bypassing authorization checks.

    It is recommended that LINQ to XML is used instead of XPath for querying XML documents. Care
    must be taken to **not** call these LINQ functions with user input as they can still lead to
    XPath
    injection:

    - `XPathEvaluate`
    - `XPathSelectElement`
    - `XPathSelectElements`

    Example using LINQ to XML to safely extract the first user from a list of users:
    ```
    // XDocument is safe from XXE attacks as the resolver is disabled by default
    XDocument doc = XDocument.Load("users.xml");
    XNamespace ns = "urn:users-schema";

    string userInput = "LastName";

    // Get all the users.
    var user = doc.Descendants(ns + "user")
                   .Select(u => new {
                      FirstName = (string)u.Element(ns + "first-name"),
                      LastName = (string)u.Element(ns + "last-name")
                   }).Where(u => u.LastName == userInput).FirstOrDefault();

    Console.WriteLine(user.FirstName + " " + user.LastName);

    it is recommended that PBKDF2 be used until one is available.

    Example using PBKDF2 to generate and compare passwords:
    ```
    const int SaltSize = 24;
    const int HashSize = 24;
    // number of pbkdf2 iterations, Rfc2898DeriveBytes uses hmac-sha1
    // so set a high iteration count
    const int Iterations = 1_300_000;
    byte[] salt = new byte[SaltSize];
    RandomNumberGenerator.Fill(salt);

    Rfc2898DeriveBytes pbkdf2 = new Rfc2898DeriveBytes("some password", salt, Iterations);
    byte[] hashBytes = pbkdf2.GetBytes(HashSize);
    // Store salt and hashedBytes in a data store such as database for authentication
    Console.WriteLine("Hash {0}", BitConverter.ToString(hashBytes).Replace("-", ""));

    External XML entities are a feature of XML parsers that allow documents to contain references
    to
    other documents or data. This feature can be abused to read files, communicate with external
    hosts,
    exfiltrate data, or cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

    XML parsers and document loaders must be configured to not resolve entities. This can be done
    by:
    - Ensuring you are running a version of .NET Framework greater than 4.5.2 (released in 2014).
    - Using `XDocument` which disables entity resolution and is generally safe from DoS.
    - Setting `XmlDocument`'s `XmlResolver` to null.
    - Setting `XmlTextReader`'s  `ProhibitDtd` to `true`
    - Setting `XmlReaderSettings` `DtdProcessing` to `DtdProcessing.Prohibit`

    By setting `XsltSettings.EnableScript` to true, an adversary who is able to influence the
    loaded
    XSL document could directly inject code to compromise the system. It is strongly
    recommended that an alternative approach is used to work with XML data.

    For increased security:

    - Never process user-supplied XSL style sheets
    - Ensure `XsltSettings.EnableScript` is set to false
    - Ensure `XsltSettings.EnableDocumentFunction` is set to false

    If the application must calculate values from XML input, instead of using XSL scripts to
    execute functions, modify the XML document prior to running the
    `XslCompiledTransform.Transform` method.

    Example of modifying the XML prior to running `Transform`:
    ```
    const String filename = "number.xml";
    const String stylesheet = "calc.xsl";

    // Compile the style sheet.
    XsltSettings xslt_settings = new XsltSettings();
    xslt_settings.EnableScript = false; // disable script
    xslt_settings.EnableDocumentFunction = false; // disable document() function
    XslCompiledTransform xslt = new XslCompiledTransform();
    XmlResolver resolver = null; // set a null entity resolver
    xslt.Load(stylesheet, xslt_settings, resolver);

    // Load the XML source file, using XDocument for safety
    XDocument doc = XDocument.Load(filename);

    // do our modifications to the document before the transformation
    // instead of inside of a script.
    doc.Element("data").Add(new XElement("circle", new XElement("radius", 12)));

    // Create an XmlWriter.
    XmlWriterSettings settings = new XmlWriterSettings();
    settings.OmitXmlDeclaration = true;
    settings.Indent = true;
    XmlWriter writer = XmlWriter.Create("output.xml", settings);
    // Finally, execute the transformation.
    xslt.Transform(doc.CreateReader(), writer);
    writer.Close();
    ```

  message: |
    Cryptographic algorithms provide many different modes of operation, only some of which provide
    message integrity. Without message integrity it could be possible for an adversary to attempt
    to tamper with the ciphertext which could lead to compromising the encryption key. Newer
    algorithms
    apply message integrity to validate ciphertext has not been tampered with.

    Instead of using an algorithm that requires configuring a `CipherMode`, an algorithm
    that has built-in message integrity should be used. If using .NET Framework greater
    than version 6.0 consider using `ChaCha20Poly1305` or `AES-256-GCM`.

    For older applications, `AES-256-GCM` is recommended, however it has many drawbacks:
    - Slower than `ChaCha20Poly1305`.
    - Catastrophic failure if nonce values are re-used.

    Example using `ChaCha20Poly1305`:
    ```
    // Generate a random key
    byte[] key = new byte[32];
    RandomNumberGenerator.Fill(key);

    ChaCha20Poly1305 encryptor = new ChaCha20Poly1305(key);

    // Note nonce values _must_ be regenerated every time they are used.
    var nonce = new byte[12];
    RandomNumberGenerator.Fill(nonce);

    byte[] plainText = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Secret text to encrypt");
    byte[] cipherText = new byte[plainText.Length];
    var authTag = new byte[16];

    encryptor.Encrypt(nonce, plainText, cipherText, authTag);
    byte[] output = new byte[cipherText.Length];
    encryptor.Decrypt(nonce, cipherText, authTag, output);
    Console.WriteLine("Output: {0}", System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString(output));
    ```

    Example using `AES-256-GCM`:
    ```
    var plaintextBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Secret text to encrypt");
    var key = new byte[32];
    RandomNumberGenerator.Fill(key);

    using var aes = new AesGcm(key);
    var nonce = new byte[AesGcm.NonceByteSizes.MaxSize];
    RandomNumberGenerator.Fill(nonce);

    var cipherText = new byte[plaintextBytes.Length];
    var tag = new byte[AesGcm.TagByteSizes.MaxSize];

    aes.Encrypt(nonce, plaintextBytes, cipherText, tag);

    // Decrypt
    using (var decrypt = new AesGcm(key))
    {
        var decryptedBytes = new byte[cipherText.Length];

        decrypt.Decrypt(nonce, cipherText, tag, decryptedBytes);

    due to not including the `[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]` attribute on an

    The vulnerability can be exploited by an adversary creating a link or form on a third
    party site and tricking an authenticated victim to access them.

    Add the `[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]` to all methods which take in user data and change
    user state (such as updating a database with a new value). This is especially true for
    functionality such as updating passwords or other security sensitive functions.

    Alternatively, applications can enable a global
    [AutoValidateAntiforgeryTokenAttribute](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.autovalidateantiforgerytokenattribute)
    filter.

    For more information on ValidateAntiForgeryToken and other CSRF protections in .NET
    see the following URL:
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/anti-request-forgery

    Additionally, consider setting all session cookies to have the `SameSite=Strict` attribute.
    It should be noted that this may impact usability when sharing links across other mediums.
    It is recommended that a two cookie based approach is taken, as outlined in the

    The application dynamically constructs file or path information. If the path
    information comes from user input, it could be abused to read sensitive files,
    access other users data, or aid in exploitation to gain further system access.

    User input should never be used in constructing paths or files for interacting
    with the filesystem. This includes filenames supplied by user uploads or downloads.
    If possible consider hashing user input or replacing it with unique values and
    use `System.IO.Path.GetFullPath` to resolve and validate the path information
    prior to processing any file functionality.

    Example using `Path.GetFullPath` and not allowing direct user input:
    ```
    // store user input alongside an ID we control
    struct userData
    {
        public string userFilename;
        public Guid id;
    }

    class Program

            // user input, saved only as a reference
            data.userFilename = "..\\test.txt";

            // random id as the filename

    LDAP injection attacks exploit LDAP queries to influence how data is returned by
    the LDAP, or in this case an Active Directory server.

    It is recommended that newer applications use the `System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement`
    API instead of `DirectorySearcher` API as it hides the complexity of querying LDAP directly.
    However,
    the `AccountManagement` API is still susceptible to LDAP injection if a user inputs LDAP
    queries,
    including LDAP filter characters such as `*`.

    It is recommended that all input passed to LDAP querying systems encode the following values:

    - Any occurrence of the null character must be escaped as “\00”.
    - Any occurrence of the open parenthesis character must be escaped as “\28”.
    - Any occurrence of the close parenthesis character must be escaped as “\29”.
    - Any occurrence of the asterisk character must be escaped as “\2a”.
    - Any occurrence of the backslash character must be escaped as “\5c”.

    Example code that safely encodes input for use in an LDAP query using the `AccountManagement`
    API:
    ```
    using System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement;

    string EncodeLDAPString(string input) {
        // Note the \ character is replaced first
        char[] chars = new char[] { '\\', '\0', '(', ')', '*' };
        string[] encoded = new string[] { "\\5c", "\\00", "\\28", "\\29", "\\2a" };

        for (int i = 0; i < chars.Length; i++)
        {
            input = input.Replace(chars[i].ToString(), encoded[i]);
        }

        return input;
    }

    // unsafe, do not use without encoding first
    string userInput = "Administrator";
    PrincipalContext AD = new PrincipalContext(ContextType.Domain, "ad.example.dev");

    UserPrincipal u = new UserPrincipal(AD);
    string encodedUserName = EncodeLDAPString(userInput);

    // The AD search term, encoded prior to calling search
    u.SamAccountName = encodedUserName;

    // Search for user
    PrincipalSearcher search = new PrincipalSearcher(u);

    // Use FindOne to only return a single result
    UserPrincipal result = (UserPrincipal)search.FindOne();
    search.Dispose();

    // show some details
    if (result != null) {
        Console.WriteLine("User: {0}", result.DisplayName);
    } else {
        Console.WriteLine("user not found");
    }
    ```

    The same encoding method shown in `EncodeLDAPString` can also be used when using the
    older `DirectorySearcher` API.

    The application may allow open redirects if created using user supplied input. Open redirects
    are
    commonly
    abused in phishing attacks where the original domain or URL looks like a legitimate link, but
    then
    redirects a user to a malicious site. An example would be
    `https://example.com/redirect?url=https://%62%61%64%2e%63%6f%6d%2f%66%61%6b%65%6c%6f%67%69%6e`
    which,
    when decoded, turns into `bad.com/fakelogin`.

    Never redirect a client based on user input. It is recommended that the list of target links
    to
    redirect a user to are contained server side, and retrieved using a numerical value
    as an index to return the link to be redirected to. For example, `/redirect?id=1` would cause
    the
    application to look up the `1` index and return a URL such as `https://example.com`. This URL
    would
    then be used to redirect the user, using the 301 response code and `Location` header.

  message: |
    Deserialization attacks exploit the process of reading serialized data and turning it back into an
    object. By constructing malicious objects and serializing them, an adversary may attempt to:

    - Inject code that is executed upon object construction, which occurs during the deserialization process.
    - Exploit mass assignment by including fields that are not normally a part of the serialized data but are
      read in during deserialization.

    Microsoft recommends no longer using the following serialization formats:

    - BinaryFormatter
    - SoapFormatter
    - NetDataContractSerializer
    - LosFormatter
    - ObjectStateFormatter

    Consider safer alternatives such as serializing data in the JSON format. Ensure any format chosen allows
    the application to specify exactly which object types are allowed to be deserialized. Additionally, when
    deserializing, never deserialize to base object types like `Object` and only cast to the exact object
    type that is expected.

    To protect against mass assignment, only allow deserialization of the specific fields that are required.
    If this is not easily done, consider creating an intermediary type that can be serialized with only the
    necessary fields exposed.

    For more information see Microsoft's deserialization security guide:
    https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-security-guide

    For more details on deserialization attacks in general, see OWASP's guide:
    https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Deserialization_Cheat_Sheet.html

    It should be noted that [tools exist](https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net) to automatically create
    exploit code for these vulnerabilities.

  message: |
    Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is an attack which exploits a web application or system to treat
    user input
    as markup or script code. It is important to encode the data depending on the specific context
    it
    is used in. There are at least six context types:

    - Inside HTML tags `<div>context 1</div>`
    - Inside attributes: `<div class="context 2"></div>`
    - Inside event attributes `<button onclick="context 3">button</button>`
    - Inside script blocks: `<script>var x = "context 4"</script>`
    - Unsafe element HTML assignment: `element.innerHTML = "context 5"`
    - Inside URLs: `<iframe src="context 6"></iframe><a href="context 6">link</a>`

    Script blocks alone have multiple ways they need to be encoded. Extra care must be taken if
    user input
    is ever output inside of script tags.

    User input that is displayed within the application must be encoded, sanitized or validated
    to ensure it cannot be treated as HTML or executed as Javascript code. Care must also be
    taken
    to not mix server-side templating with client-side templating, as the server-side templating
    will
    not encode things like {{ 7*7 }} which may execute client-side templating features.

    It is _NOT_ advised to encode user input prior to inserting into a data store. The data will
    need to be
    encoded depending on context of where it is output. It is much safer to force the displaying
    system to
    handle the encoding and not attempt to guess how it should be encoded.

    Consider using built-in framework capabilities for automatically encoding user input.
    Depending
    on output context, consider using the following `System.Text.Encodings.Web` encoders:

    - [HtmlEncoder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.encodings.web.htmlencoder)
    - [JavaScriptEncoder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.encodings.web.javascriptencoder)
    - [UrlEncoder](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.encodings.web.urlencoder)

  message: The software uses a signed primitive and performs a cast to an unsigned
    primitive, or uses an unsigned primitive and performs a cast to a signed primitive,
    which can produce an unexpected value. When the result of a function is to be
    used as a size parameter, using negative return values can have unexpected results.
    Although less frequent an issue, unsigned-to-signed conversion can be  the precursor
    to buffer underwrite conditions. Buffer underwrites  occur frequently when large
    unsigned values are cast to signed values,  and then used as indexes into a buffer
    or for pointer arithmetic.

  message: The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow
    or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be
    larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation
    is used for resource management or execution control. When influenced by the size
